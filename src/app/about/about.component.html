            With a background in mathematics, I hold a Ph.D. in the subject. This academic journey has proven to be a
            valuable asset for me as a Frontend Developer. Mathematics has honed my problem-solving skills, cultivated a
            keen attention to detail, and instilled in me a strong analytical mindset. These qualities have seamlessly
            translated into the world of web development, where precision and creative problem-solving are paramount.
            It's the perfect foundation
            for creating elegant and efficient frontend solutions.

            Schönheit des Abstrakten. Bei Programmierung: Schönheit von clean code.

            During my academic pursuit, it became clear that my true passion lay in programming and software
            development. This realization marked a turning point in my life. The transition from mathematical proofs to
            coding logic felt natural on the one hand, yet like discovering the missing piece of the puzzle in my
            journey. Now, I'm fully immersed in
            the world of software development, constantly learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in web
            design and interactivity.
